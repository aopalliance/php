PHP AOP Alliance

===

The PHP AOP Alliance project is a joint open-source project between several software engineering people who are interested in AOP and PHP.

LICENCE: all the source code provided by AOP Alliance is Public Domain.

We believe that Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) offers a better solution to many problems than do existing technologies such as Signal Slots, Event Dispatchers.

AOP Alliance intends to facilitate and standardize the use of AOP to enhance existing middleware environments, or development environements.
The AOP Alliance also aims to ensure interoperability between PHP AOP implementations to build a larger PHP AOP community.
